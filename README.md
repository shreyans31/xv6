# Modified_XV6

## Added different UNIX functionalities in XV6 operating system.

### List of different functionalites commands are:

1. ps - list of all processes.
2. history - which prints the history of commands executed.
3. statistics - prints all different stats for that process like creation time, runnable time, sleeping time, etc.
4. bigfile - which increases the maximum file size of XV6 operating system with visualisation of creating blocks.
5. clear - which clears the whole window.
6. You can also traverse the commands using arrows keys as in UNIX operating system.
7. You can also print the names of all system calls executed after running any command or process.
   (We can enable or disable this functionality using cltr + s).
